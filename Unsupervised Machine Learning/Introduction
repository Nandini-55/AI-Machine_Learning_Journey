### ðŸ“ˆ Unsupervised Machine Learning  

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an **unlabeled dataset**.  
This means the data only contains **input features (X)** and no corresponding output labels.  
The goal is for the model to **discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings** in the data.  

- **Examples:**  
  - Grouping customers by shopping behavior (Clustering)  
  - Reducing high-dimensional data for visualization (Dimensionality Reduction)  

- **Types of Unsupervised Learning:**  
  1. **Clustering** â†’ Group similar data points  
     - e.g., customer segmentation, document grouping  
  2. **Dimensionality Reduction** â†’ Simplify data while keeping important information  
     - e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE  

- **Common Algorithms:**  
  - K-Means Clustering  
  - Hierarchical Clustering  
  - DBSCAN  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
  - Autoencoders (for deep learning)
