### üîç Supervised Machine Learning  

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a **labeled dataset**.  
This means the data contains **input features (X)** and their corresponding **output labels (y)**.  
The goal is for the model to **learn the mapping function** from inputs to outputs, so it can make predictions on unseen data.  

- **Examples:**  
  - Predicting house prices (Regression)  
  - Classifying emails as spam or not spam (Classification)  

- **Types of Supervised Learning:**  
  1. **Regression** ‚Üí Predict continuous values  
     - e.g., predicting temperature, stock prices  
  2. **Classification** ‚Üí Predict categorical values  
     - e.g., disease detection (positive/negative), handwriting recognition  

- **Common Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees & Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
